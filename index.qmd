# Welcome to my website!

I'm a Chancellor's Fellow at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland. I'm a Social Epidemiologist and a Registered Nurse by background.

I conduct research which aims to better understand how health inequalities are constructed and ways that we can reduce them. I use observational linked health and social data and apply counterfactual causal inference methods.
