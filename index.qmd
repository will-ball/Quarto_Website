# Welcome to my website!

I'm a [Chancellor's Fellow](https://rgu-repository.worktribe.com/person/2005477/william-ball) at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland. I'm a Social Epidemiologist and a Registered Nurse by background.

I conduct research which aims to better understand how health inequalities are constructed and ways that we can reduce them. I use observational linked health and social data and apply counterfactual causal inference methods.
