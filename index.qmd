# Welcome to my website!

I'm a Research Fellow at the University of Aberdeen, working on the Networked Data Lab grant. We use health records and other linked data to address local and national issues related to health and inequalities. In the past we've looked at the construction of shielding lists during the COVID-19 pandemic and inequalities in children's mental health.

My research interests include health inequalities, social epidemiology and causal inference methods. I conduct quantitative research on health records and linked administrative data.
