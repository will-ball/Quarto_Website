<p><img src="https://wpball.com/posts/posts/COP26/climatejustice.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>COP26 in Glasgow is now coming to a close. National commitments are being finalised and delegates and world leaders are preparing to leave the conference bubble and return home. I’m going to share some of my closing thoughts about the conference itself, as well as propose something which I think could be done to improve future editions.</p>
<p><strong>Where do the negotiations stand?</strong></p>
<p>Some recent analysis of the likely impact of negotiations at COP26 has estimated that we are on track to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/09/cop26-sets-course-for-disastrous-heating-of-more-than-24c-says-key-report">global temperature rises of 2.4 degrees Celsius</a>. Given the hopes around these talks, and the very real impacts of climate change which are already being felt around the world, this is disappointing to say the least.</p>
<p>At COP21 in Paris in 2015 parties committed again to the aim of keeping global temperature rises below 2 degrees, and preferably below 1.5 degrees (relative to the pre-industrial period). They have clearly failed to achieve this and are apparently not on target for this in the future. The ‘ratchet mechanism’ which was also implemented at the Paris talks means that COP26 was the first point at which signatories have been obliged to submit revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).</p>
<p>NDCs are the short term commitments that each country makes to cut emissions and are one of the key features of these negotiations in Glasgow. Countries are essentially in talks between themselves to make larger contributions. At present we can see that these contributions, particularly from countries with the greatest share of emissions, are not anywhere near ambitious enough.</p>
<p><strong>Deja vu?</strong></p>
<p>It seems that COP26 is increasingly being seen as more of the same and yet another missed opportunity.</p>
<p>The aim of limiting global temperature rises to 2 degrees has <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-the-ratchet-mechanism-within-the-paris-climate-deal">been officially adopted in climate talks since 2010</a> and later reinforced at the Paris conference. Repeatedly failing to reach this target is worrying.</p>
<p>I’ve seen an excellent twitter thread which <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1455306187398914048.html">drew parallels between COP26 in Glasgow and COP15 in Copenhagen</a> and not simply because of the cold, wet weather. Both sets of talks were billed as ‘last chances’ and have been characterised by processes of negotiation which are exclusive of civil society voices. Practical considerations around lack of affordable travel or accommodation options have also placed barriers in the way of allowing people from developing countries making contributions.</p>
<p><strong>Are we all doomed?</strong></p>
<p>All of this can be quite alarming and depressing to onlookers from the outside of these talks. Things don’t look good and worst of all, we know that the effects of climate change will be hardest felt by those who have contributed the least to the problem and who have the least resources to mitigate the impacts.</p>
<p>At the national and international levels, those who have the power to make effective changes are trapped in a way of ‘<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/sth.2015.12">Utopian thinking</a>’. It is politically beneficial for politicians to engage with climate change issues and many do. Boris Johnson has used the UK presidency of COP26 to appear like an international leader on the issue, despite a poor track record in the UK parliament. However, they are so invested in the social and economic systems which worsen the problem that they cannot propose or support realistic action.</p>
<p>Our established economic structures which prioritise growth over health and wellbeing are destructive. The capitalism which produces waste and exploits the global south is unable to save us.</p>
<p>Things may feel hopeless, but this hopelessness actually hurts us. Our fate might seem inevitable but we must still maintain hope for change.</p>
<p><strong>People Power</strong></p>
<p>Attending COP26 was a surreal experience for me. Feeling at once very close to world events and also held at arms length. I heard many encouraging conversations within the conference but felt detached from the ongoing negotiations and put off by the ubiquitous presence of petro-chemical companies, billionaires and other financial or industrial actors.</p>
<p>By far the most inspiring moment in my week in Glasgow was attending the Fridays for Future Climate Strike march from Kelvingrove Park to George Square. The event was organised by students and attended by thousands of people, including trade union groups, indigenous campaigners and others from a range of political perspectives.</p>
<p>I saw banners and heard participants explicitly linked <a href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1456670075717570563">climate justice with health and social inequalities</a>. So many of the things which have not been discussed within the SEC. This mobilisation of real people, talking plainly about structural issues which require ambitious solutions gave me hope, as do organisations like <a href="https://cop26coalition.org/">COP Coalition</a>.</p>
<p><strong>United Nations Global Citizen’s Assembly on Climate</strong></p>
<p>I have many thoughts about what we can and should do to address climate change but I want to share one idea with you which would be relatively easy to implement by the UN and could change the way our international leaders address these issues.</p>
<p>I propose a Global Citizen’s Assembly on Climate, to coincide with COP meetings. For those who don’t know, a citizen’s assembly can be a form of participatory or deliberative democracy. A cross-section of people from around the world would convene to study the topic of climate change and explore potential methods of addressing the problem. They would engage with experts to establish facts and produce a set of recommendations for action to be taken by UN member states.</p>
<p>Running alongside (or just before) the international negotiations, this process could provide much needed accountability as well as prioritising the voices of real people and otherwise marginalised or excluded voices.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><img src="https://wpball.com/posts/posts/COP26/globe.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>I’m a Registered Nurse and a Population Health researcher. I’m also very concerned about climate change and the challenges it poses to us as a global community. One of my big motivations for attending COP26 was exploring the relationship between climate change and health, as well as the similarities between the two issues. What I’ve found has been quite shocking.</p>
<p><strong>Health is not a priority</strong></p>
<p>In the first few days that I’ve been here I have listening to talks, reviewed media reports and read about the ongoing international negotiations. I am struck by how little focus there is on health.</p>
<p>Each day at the conference has a theme. These include energy, nature, finance, transport and gender but nothing on arguably the most important measure of societal success: human health and well-being. Save for the World Health Organisation’s ‘Health Pavilion’ (One of 80+ in the SEC) you might struggle to find any discussion around the impacts of climate change on global health.</p>
<p><strong>Health Inequalities and Climate Change</strong></p>
<p>I think when we talk about these two issues there are strong similarities. Both are problems that are largely caused by systemic forces. Social, economic and power structures which create and reinforce problems. Crucially the impacts of these structures and systems are not equally distributed.</p>
<p>Health outcomes are generally worst in the most deprived places and for people with the least access to resources which can improve their health. The worst effects of climate change are and will be felt the hardest by those in the Global South, who are <strong>simultaneously the most vulnerable and those who contribute the least to causing the problem</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the biggest similarities is that the solutions to these issues are very often framed around behavioural change and individual actions. Sections of the media, national governments and industries promote this approach to distract from their own questionable behaviour and responsibilities.</p>
<p>If we are to face down these challenges, and have any hope of real change, we must acknowledge the true barriers and work to dismantle them.</p>
<p><strong>Next Blog Post</strong></p>
<p>Later this week I’ll be returning to Aberdeen and will be writing up some of my thoughts and reflections around COP26 and perhaps suggesting a few ways the whole thing could be done better!</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><img src="https://wpball.com/posts/posts/COP26/peoplemakeglasgow.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This afternoon I arrived in the City of Glasgow to attend COP26 as an official Observer on behalf of the University of Aberdeen.</p>
<p>At the same time, global heads of state have also converged on the city for two days which kick off the international negotiations. Today these leaders are giving opening statements. Some have shared their actions to date to reduce climate change, others have outlined their ambitions for these talks and some have urged that the wealthiest nations among them to do more.</p>
<p>Alongside these world leaders and their delegations, corporate interests are also well represented as partners (i.e.&nbsp;sponsors). They are all eager to be seen as taking action or making a difference. As I have arrived in the city from my home in Aberdeen I am struck by the people who do not have the opportunity to attend.</p>
<p>Leaders from around the world are here but the extent of their influence is hugely variable. Countries from the global south and those with developing economies will hold little sway in the coming negotiations. These places, which have contributed the least to causing climate change &amp; who will suffer the most, are marginalised in these discussions.</p>
<p>Organisational failings in the run up to the conference have exacerbated this issue too. Problems and delays with the accreditation and visa processes, lack of access to vaccinations, changing travel restrictions as well as expensive and scarce accommodation options <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/oct/30/cop26-will-be-whitest-and-most-privileged-ever-warn-campaigners">have all contributed to this problem</a>.</p>
<p>My first impression of this conference is that it is highly exclusionary. I worry that important and constructive discussions, which will happen in this city during these weeks and beyond, will be overshadowed by a lack of ambition and commitment to action at the international level. I hope that I am proved wrong.</p>
<p>In the coming days I will be posting another blog in this series, exploring the potentially devastating impact climate change will have health inequalities.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><img src="https://wpball.com/posts/posts/COP26/glasgow.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>This November COP26 is coming to Glasgow and I will be attending on behalf of the University of Aberdeen who have been given Official Observer status. This post is the first a series which I am planning to raise awareness about the conference, what I’ll be doing while I’m there and how climate change impacts on health and inequalities.</p>
<p>Below I’ll be answering some common questions ahead of some more substantive posts in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>What is COP26?</strong></p>
<p>COP26 is 26th edition of the ‘Conference of Parties’ for the wing of the United Nations which is concerned with climate change. It’s a UN-led international meeting where countries will come together to review and negotiate global action. It was due to take place in 2020 but was postponed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>This year, the United Kingdom is hosting the conference and attendees include national delegations from around the world, environmental charities &amp; activists, research groups, trade unions as well as representatives from business and industry.</p>
<p>Many world leaders will be attending but the President of China (the country which is thought to be the biggest emitter of CO2) has already confirmed he will not and the President of Russia (the country which produces the most natural gas for energy use) has suggested he may not attend either.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this one important?</strong></p>
<p>These meetings take place each year but the 2021 edition is particularly important.</p>
<p>In 2015 attendees adopted the Paris Agreement at COP21. This included a commitment to keep global warming to under at most 2 degrees, but preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius. As part of the Paris Agreement signatories provided outlines of their national contributions and agreed to review and enhance these contributions every 5 years.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic delayed this process by a year but has also provided an opportunity for the global community to engage in a reassessment of the ways we structure our societies and economies which could result in a fairer, greener and more sustainable future.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What is an Official Observer?</strong></p>
<p>The meeting itself is mainly designed to bring together member states but other groups are able to attend and provide external scrutiny to proceedings. Certain interested organisations are granted Official Observer status, meaning that they can attend the conference as well.</p>
<p>Observer organisations generally try to raise awareness about the proceedings, assess the commitments being made, highlight where parties are not being ambitious enough and generally apply pressure to do more.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to being there in person and sharing my experiences with you. As a Registered Nurse and Health Inequalities Researcher, I also want to focus on the ramifications this meeting has for health and inequalities.</p>
<p><strong>What are the chances of success?</strong></p>
<p>Greta Thunberg <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2021/sep/25/greta-thunberg-i-really-see-the-value-of-friendship-apart-from-the-climate-almost-nothing-else-matters">was not optimistic about the conference</a> and said “Nothing has changed from previous years really. The leaders will say ‘we’ll do this and we’ll do this, and we will put our forces together and achieve this’, and then they will do nothing. Maybe some symbolic things and creative accounting and things that don’t really have a big impact. We can have as many COPs as we want, but nothing real will come out of it.”.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I find out more?</strong></p>

  <title>Inequalities and COVID-19</title>
  <dc:creator>William P Ball</dc:creator>
  <link>https://wpball.com/posts/posts/COVID Inequality/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><img src="https://wpball.com/posts/posts/COVID Inequality/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>COVID19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus) has become ubiquitous, affecting nearly all nations and regions and dominating global interest since the start of 2020.</strong></p>
<p>In the very early stages, there was a large amount of press attention (In the UK at least) surrounding celebrities who had tested positive, including members of the Royal family and Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who became ill enough to be admitted to an Intensive Care Unit.</p>
<p>This apparently prompted some in Government and beyond to state that the disease was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-leveller-trfn/uk-under-fire-for-suggesting-coronavirus-great-leveller-idUSKCN21R30P">‘<em>a great leveller</em>’</a> affecting rich and poor alike. There was, rightly, a large backlash against this idea and, whilst perhaps inconvenient for some political outlooks, early evidence suggests that the impacts of COVID19 are not equally distributed within populations.</p>
<p>This should not be surprising to us. Inequalities in health have been observed through time, in multiple contexts and pathologies. We know that socioeconomic factors influence health and behaviours and it follows that the underlying mechanisms behind this will be replicated today. Some of the key risk/prognostic factors in COVID19 identified from data thus far, such as High BMI, diabetes and other pre-existing conditions, are socially patterned, with higher prevalence in more deprived areas/groups. Occupations which are classed as higher risk, due to higher likelihood of exposure, are predominantly those which are considered to be in a lower social class. Indeed, many of the ‘key workers’ identified as important to the continued running of society under heavy restrictions are low-paid and low-status.</p>
<p>Racial/Ethnic considerations are also hugely important. Systematic and structural discrimination of these groups results in a higher representation in disadvantaged areas and socioeconomic classifications. Analysis in the US, UK and other parts of Europe has shown that areas with higher proportions of BAME or indigenous populations are those which have been worst affected by COVID19 mortality.</p>
<p>Death registration figures from the Office for National Statistics confirm that a Deprivation gradient exists. They found mortality rates in the most deprived areas are over twice those in the least deprived areas. Similarly, the Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre <a href="https://www.icnarc.org/DataServices/Attachments/Download/cbcb6217-f698-ea11-9125-00505601089b">found disease severity in COVID patients also conforms to this gradient</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, it is not just the disease which highlights the importance of pre-existing inequalities. The restriction or lockdown measures, implemented around the world to slow the rate of transmission of the virus, have a disproportionate effect on the most deprived groups. Low paid workers in the service industry were under pressure to continue working with minimal protections (putting themselves at increased risk), or face losing their jobs before lockdown measures were officially enforced in the UK. Those in insecure employment, with zero-hours contracts, or in the ‘gig economy’ have little to no security net, whilst higher paid/valued occupations are more able to adapt to working from home. These factors will only play a greater role in the medium to long term recovery, as efforts inevitably pivot towards economic recovery.</p>
<p>To best mitigate the effects of COVID19 and policy responses, I echo calls that we urgently need to prioritise an equity approach and begin to adopt more widespread <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2020/05/08/jech-2020-214297.long">measurement of socioeconomic factors</a>. In the early period of this pandemic, urgency may have led to the prioritisation of simple demographic information collection, thought to be more clinically relevant, but we can do better.</p>
<p>Acknowledgement of the importance of socioeconomic factors and collection of pertinent information will help us to understand the mechanisms which unfairly heap misery on the most vulnerable in our society. We can begin to better identify at-risk populations and formulate policy responses which mitigate the impacts more fairly.</p>

  <title>Nursing ‘as a man’</title>
  <dc:creator>William P Ball</dc:creator>
  <link>https://wpball.com/posts/posts/Nursing as a Man/index.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p><img src="https://wpball.com/posts/posts/Nursing as a Man/featured.jpg" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p><strong>Only around 10% of Nurses in the UK are male. Campaigns are attempting to encourage more male applicants to Nursing degrees, but is that the best solution to the staffing crisis?</strong></p>
<p>My very first placement as a student Nurse took place on a busy Acute Admissions Unit at a large central London hospital. After a few weeks I had begun to settle in and had developed some relationships with my colleagues. One day in the middle of a short spell on nice weather the ward was unusually quiet. Some of the team were sat completing paperwork and a discussion started. A senior female pharmacist who I had worked with a few times asked me, “so Will, why – as a man – did you want to be a Nurse?”</p>
<p>On face value, it’s a question I’d been asked a few times before that point – what was my motivation for becoming a Nurse? But I was taken aback – why such heavy emphasis on my motivations ‘as a man’?</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have expected that sort of question. Nursing is after all an occupation which is ~90% female in the UK and representations of Nurses have traditionally been female. Our society still understands ‘caring’ as a feminine characteristic. Caring roles and responsibilities (perhaps owing to this gendered association) are seen as lower value and lower status - offering relatively low (or no) wages.</p>
<p>Aside from the pay and conditions of care workers, the UK Parliament estimated in 2018 that 6.5 million individuals (likely to be predominantly female) provided unpaid care for children, family or friends at an estimated equivalent cost of up to <a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/POST-PN-0582/POST-PN-0582.pdf">£100 billion</a>, roughly three-quarters of the total annual NHS budget.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons the Nursing workforce is in the midst of a staffing crisis, with over 40,000 vacancies across the UK. Some see the gender imbalance in Nursing as an opportunity to solve this crisis - by getting more men to apply. A few campaigns have been set up in recent years to get ‘Men in Nursing’.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think some aspects of these campaigns are problematic and misguided. Seeking to appeal to men, some of the stereotypes of Nursing (e.g.&nbsp;the use of gendered titles like ‘Sister’ or ‘Matron’) are framed as almost discriminatory barriers to entry for men. This approach buys into the idea that ‘feminine’ caring qualities are negatives for men.</p>
<p>Despite claims towards wider aims, these campaigns seem to see employing more men as an ‘end’ in itself, ignoring (and sometimes feeding into) wider issues related to caring professions. These campaigns also fail to address male privilege in Nursing. Even in a female dominated profession, men occupy more space in positions of power, being over-represented at higher pay bands and in management roles. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002074891930046X">Likewise, male Nurses are advantaged in terms of opportunity, progressing through pay bands faster than their female colleagues</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of targetting Men who might see Nursing as ‘too feminine’ for them to consider, I think we should adopt a much broader approach which deals with rebalancing caring responsibilities and valuing care work (paid and unpaid) – combatting gender essentialism as well as striving to improve pay, conditions and recognition of work predominantly undertaken by women. If those cultural perceptions begin to change, more men will start to join professions like Nursing.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of my journey to becoming a Nurse, the only way I could respond to that Pharmacist’s question was to say, “for the same reasons a woman would want to be a Nurse.”</p>
