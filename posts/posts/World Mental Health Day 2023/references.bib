	abstract = {Mental health disorders in children and adolescents are highly prevalent yet undertreated. A detailed understanding of the reasons for not seeking or accessing help as perceived by young people is crucial to address this gap. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO 42018088591) of quantitative and qualitative studies reporting barriers and facilitators to children and adolescents seeking and accessing professional help for mental health problems. We identified 53 eligible studies; 22 provided quantitative data, 30 provided qualitative data, and one provided both. Four main barrier/facilitator themes were identified. Almost all studies (96\%) reported barriers related to young people’s individual factors, such as limited mental health knowledge and broader perceptions of help-seeking. The second most commonly (92\%) reported theme related to social factors, for example, perceived social stigma and embarrassment. The third theme captured young people’s perceptions of the therapeutic relationship with professionals (68\%) including perceived confidentiality and the ability to trust an unknown person. The fourth theme related to systemic and structural barriers and facilitators (58\%), such as financial costs associated with mental health services, logistical barriers, and the availability of professional help. The findings highlight the complex array of internal and external factors that determine whether young people seek and access help for mental health difficulties. In addition to making effective support more available, targeted evidence-based interventions are required to reduce perceived public stigma and improve young people’s knowledge of mental health problems and available support, including what to expect from professionals and services.},

	abstract = {Introduction One in eight children in the United Kingdom are estimated to have a mental health condition, and many do not receive support or treatment. Childhood is a key period for long-term mental health trajectories and the prevalence of poor mental health is not evenly distributed across age-groups, by sex or socioeconomic groups. Equity in access to health care is a policy priority but relatively under-researched. This work aims to inform service planning and provision by linking previously unlinked individual-level data from community and specialist outpatient settings. We describe the trends in treatment and service use among children and adolescents in NHS Grampian to understand the socio-demographic characteristics and inequalities in access to mental health services and care. Methods We linked records for all mental health prescriptions and all referrals to specialist CAMHS between the years of 2015 and 2021 for children aged 2 to 17 in the NHS Grampian health board (North East of Scotland). We analysed trends in prescribing, referrals, and acceptance to out-patient treatment over time, and measured differences in treatment and service use rates by age, sex and area deprivation. Results We identified 18,732 individuals across the two datasets and a total of 178,657 mental health prescriptions and 21,874 referrals to specialist CAMHS. Monthly prescriptions of mental health medications increased by 59\% over the study period. Boys received almost double the number of prescriptions than girls. Primary school aged boys were more likely to receive medications to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and high-school aged girls were more likely to receive anti-depressant medications. The rate of prescribing in the most deprived 10\% of areas was double that of the 10\% least deprived. The monthly referral rate for specialist CAMHS was roughly static between 2015 \&amp; the end of 2019 but increased by 9\% since the start of 2020. The rate of rejected referrals increased over time and the number of accepted referrals has remained static. However, there have been demographic changes in who is accepted for treatment. The proportion of accepted referrals who are girls has increased from 48\% in 2015 to 62\% in 2021. Discussion The large and consistent increase in mental health prescribing for children and young people since 2015 and the increase in referrals to specialist CAMHS since 2020 aligns with emerging evidence of increasing prevalence of poor mental health over time and particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The static size of referrals accepted by specialist CAMHS amid greater demand and changing demographics may represent unmet need. Data for alternative sources of treatment such as community based CAMHS is not currently available and future analysis should explore treatment trajectories of those not accepted for specialist CAMHS treatment.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was funded by the Health Foundation Networked Data Lab Programme.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The North Node Privacy Advisory Committee (NNPAC) gave ethical approval for this work (project ID: 6-063-21).

	abstract = {Data are presented on the lifetime prevalence, projected lifetime risk, and age-of-onset distributions of mental disorders in the World Health Organization (WHO)'s World Mental Health (WMH) Surveys. Face-to-face community surveys were conducted in seventeen countries in Africa, Asia, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East. The combined numbers of respondents were 85,052. Lifetime prevalence, projected lifetime risk, and age of onset of DSM-IV disorders were assessed with the WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), a fully-structured lay administered diagnostic interview. Survival analysis was used to estimate lifetime risk. Median and inter-quartile range (IQR) of age of onset is very early for some anxiety disorders (7-14, IQR: 8-11) and impulse control disorders (7-15, IQR: 11-12). The age-of-onset distribution is later for mood disorders (29-43, IQR: 35-40), other anxiety disorders (24-50, IQR: 31-41), and substance use disorders (18-29, IQR: 21-26). Median and IQR lifetime prevalence estimates are: anxiety disorders 4.8-31.0\% (IQR: 9.9-16.7\%), mood disorders 3.3-21.4\% (IQR: 9.8-15.8\%), impulse control disorders 0.3-25.0\% (IQR: 3.1-5.7\%), substance use disorders 1.3-15.0\% (IQR: 4.8-9.6\%), and any disorder 12.0-47.4\% (IQR: 18.1-36.1\%). Projected lifetime risk is proportionally between 17\% and 69\% higher than estimated lifetime prevalence (IQR: 28-44\%), with the highest ratios in countries exposed to sectarian violence (Israel, Nigeria, and South Africa), and a general tendency for projected risk to be highest in recent cohorts in all countries. These results document clearly that mental disorders are commonly occurring. As many mental disorders begin in childhood or adolescents, interventions aimed at early detection and treatment might help reduce the persistence or severity of primary disorders and prevent the subsequent onset of secondary disorders.},
